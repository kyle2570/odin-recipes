    <p>
        Easy and tasty breaded tofu recipe. A vegan main dish served with brown rice. It's delicious! I use sprouted tofu, it's better for digestion!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegan mayonnaise (such as Follow Your Heart® Veganaise®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>¼ cup bread crumbs, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package tofu, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil. </li>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise and water together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip tofu slices in the mayonnaise mixture; press tofu into the bread crumbs until fully coated. Place coated tofu in the prepared baking dish. </li>
