    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>These split peas are my new favourite snack, they are crunchy, salty and incredibly addicting. After soaking the yellow split peas for 4 hours, they take less than 10 minutes to cook. In the photo above you can see how much the split peas expand after soaking. I like eating them lightly seasoned with salt but they also taste great with chili, cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic, smoked paprika, rosemary, thyme or curry powder. The options are endless.</p>

    <p>They remain crisp for a few days after cooking, so make a big batch and store them in a jar on the counter to snack on whenever hunger hits. A bowl of split peas is a great dish to serve to guests, complimenting a glass of wine or added to a salad for that crunchy texture. Give these split peas a try and let me know what you seasoned them with. Happy snacking!</p>
